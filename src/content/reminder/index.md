<blockquote class="manifesto">I must not fear. 
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past i will turn the inner eye to see its path. where teh fear has gone there will be nothing. only i will remain.</blockquote>
